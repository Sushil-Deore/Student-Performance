## Student Performance


Student Performance Indicator is a machine learning project that operates on a rich dataset containing valuable information about students. The dataset includes factors such as:

- **Gender:** The sex of students (Male/Female).
- **Race/Ethnicity:** The ethnicity of students, categorized into groups (Group A, B, C, D, E).
- **Parental Level of Education:** The final education level of parents, with options including Bachelor's Degree, Some College, Master's Degree, Associate's Degree, and High School.
- **Lunch:** Whether students had standard or free/reduced lunch before the test.
- **Test Preparation Course:** Whether students completed the test preparation course before the test.
- **Math Score:** The score achieved by students in mathematics.
- **Reading Score:** The score achieved by students in reading.
- **Writing Score:** The score achieved by students in writing.

In the process of developing this machine learning project, several crucial data checks will be performed, including:

1. **Check for Missing Values:** Ensuring that there are no gaps or missing data in the dataset, which could affect the quality of analysis and predictions.

2. **Check for Duplicates:** Identifying and handling any duplicate records to maintain data integrity.

3. **Data Type Verification:** Ensuring that the data types of each column are appropriate for analysis and model development.

4. **Number of Unique Values:** Understanding the uniqueness of data in each column, which can inform feature engineering and modeling decisions.

5. **Statistical Analysis:** Exploring the basic statistics of the dataset, including measures of central tendency and variability, to gain initial insights into the data distribution.

6. **Categorical Column Analysis:** Investigating the various categories present in different categorical columns to understand their distribution and potential impact on student performance predictions.

Key insights from the analysis of this dataset include:

- **Lunch, Race, and Parental Education:** The analysis reveals that students' performance is significantly related to factors such as their lunch type, race/ethnicity, and parental level of education. These factors play a crucial role in predicting student success.

- **Gender Disparity:** Females consistently lead in pass percentage and often achieve top scores across subjects. This gender-based performance difference is a noteworthy observation.

- **Test Preparation Course:** Surprisingly, the analysis suggests that student performance is not strongly correlated with whether they completed a test preparation course. However, it is important to note that finishing the preparation course appears to be beneficial, even if not directly related to performance.

These insights highlight the complexity of factors influencing student performance and underscore the importance of a holistic approach to understanding and improving educational outcomes. The machine learning model developed in this project aims to harness these insights to predict student performance and provide valuable guidance for educators and policymakers.
